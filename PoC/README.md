# PoC

This folder is where all proof of concept work goes.

Whenever we are working on a new technology, we should first prove it out
in a seperate location. Each PoC should have it's own subfolder. This way,
information can proliferate in the most efficient manner. This is how we
develop at Pelori and I want this practice to be implemented in this team
as well.
